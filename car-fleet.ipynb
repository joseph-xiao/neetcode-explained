    "[Car Fleet](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are `n` cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination is `target` miles away.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two integer array `position` and `speed`, both of length `n`, where `position[i]` is the position of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car and `speed[i]` is the speed of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> car (in miles per hour).\n",
    "\n",
    "A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper to bumper **at the same speed**. The faster car will **slow down** to match the slower car's speed. The distance between these two cars is ignored (i.e., they are assumed to have the same position).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **car fleet** is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed. Note that a single car is also a car fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be considered as one car fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **number of car fleets** that will arrive at the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The cars starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12.\n",
    "The car starting at 0 does not catch up to any other car, so it is a fleet by itself.\n",
    "The cars starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.\n",
    "Note that no other cars meet these fleets before the destination, so the answer is 3.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: There is only one car, hence there is only one fleet.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The cars starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The fleet moves at speed 2.\n",
    "Then, the fleet (speed 2) and the car starting at 4 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n == position.length == speed.length`\n",
    "- <code>1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>\n",
    "- <code>0 < target <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>\n",
    "- `0 <= position[i] < target`\n",
    "- All the values of position are **unique**.\n",
    "- <code>0 < speed[i] <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>\n"
